# Restaurant Opening Hours API

## Introduction

The objective of this task is to develop an API server and documentation for easy navigation and interaction with restaurant opening hours data by the frontend team.

To maintain consistency with our project, we prefer the use of Angular for the frontend, ASP.Net Core for the backend, and Cosmos DB for the database.

## Raw Data

Here is the raw data for restaurant opening hours: [hours.csv](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ramzan-bs-23/bbc98dc64516242ccdb37fbd08b7cc4f/raw/dd55d01a7fc8efcbb08c5a2062b5c59c3c0471f9/hours.csv).

Please treat this data as a raw source that requires extraction, transformation, and loading into the database.

## The Task

Your task is to construct an API server with comprehensive documentation allowing for the filtering of restaurants by date and time, as well as by restaurant name. Please also consider implementing pagination and sorting functionalities.

## Bonus

Write appropriate tests along with a coverage report to ensure the robustness of the system.

## Deployment

We highly appreciate if you could deploy this solution on Azure.

## What We Look For

- Adherence to specifications
- Consistency of endpoint design
- Code style
- Application of design patterns and principles
- Good development practices such as committing discipline and unit testing
